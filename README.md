# Skydio ROS proxy

## Getting started

First, get access to the Skydio SDK and follow steps as described [here](https://github.com/Skydio/skydio-skills).
You will need to upload the contents of the folder *skillset* to your skydio skillset.
This package contains a slightly modified version of the skydio UDP link code with support for the
voxel map and other channels.

The package contains a simple "industrial inspection" skill that flies to predefined camera poses
defined by waypoints and gimbal angles, and lands at the end. It streams the vehicle voxel map,
pose, gimbal pose, and the downsampled 15Hz user camera stream.

## Installation

### Installation steps
1. Create a ROS workspace, for example ``~/catkin_ws/``
2. Clone this repo into ``~/catkin_ws/src/`` to get ``~/catkin_ws/src/skydio_proxy/``
3. Clone [gscam](https://github.com/ros-drivers/gscam) into ``~/catkin_ws/src/``
4. Install packages for gscam:

    ``sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0 libgstreamer1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-ffmpeg gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev``

5. Build the workspace -- run ``catkin_make`` in the top-level workspace directory

    ``~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make``

### Running
The package has an example roslaunch file, ``launch/proxy.launch``. Edit the parameters at the top
of the file.

To use the skills, you have to upload them to the cloud API, as described in the Skydio SDK
documentation. To run the proxy with a cloud simulation, you have to download the simulation token
locally. A token is not needed for running the proxy with a vehicle.

The first time you authenticate with the cloud, an email will be sent with an authentication code.
You can enter the code when ``udp_proxy.py`` prompts, even from roslaunch. This will store a file
into ``~/.skydio_cloud_api``, so it only has to be done once.

To run the proxy with a GUI, run

    roslaunch skydio_proxy proxy.launch

## ROS Proxy
To start the proxy, call

    rosrun skydio_proxy nodes/udp_proxy.py

This will connect to the vehicle and expose the /skydio_command service. In order to start a mission,
you will need to setup your user email and skillset name.
In order to go to PREP mode and start streaming video and messages, run

    rosservice call /skydio_command prep

Note that this will heat up the vehicle significantly if not flying. It is recommended to cool the
R1 with an external fan while in this mode.

To take off or land:

    rosservice call /skydio_command takeoff
    rosservice call /skydio_command land

To switch to inspection.industrial_inspection skill.p:

    rosservice call /skydio_command start_mission

All of this can be done from the simple *service_gui.py* node, which just calls the corresponding
services on button presses. To start just the user camera stream to ROS:

     roslaunch skydio_proxy launch/camera_stream.launch

The voxel republisher node translates RLE-encoded voxel map coming from the drone and publishes it
as a point cloud. It is written in C++, so you have to compile the package first. It is very
rudimentary, and only publishes the current voxel map, along with a filtered version. There is a lot
of room for improvement for this node, so feel free to fork and make a pull request.
To start the voxel republisher node, run

     rosrun skydio_proxy voxel_republisher_node

The launch file *proxy.launch* will start the udp proxy, voxel republisher, user camera stream, and
the service GUI. Make sure to setup your user email and skillset name first.

## Webcam
Packages:

    sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0 gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-ffmpeg gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly 

Start webcam stream to RTP:

    gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device="/dev/video0" ! image/jpeg,width=1280,height=720,framerate=60/1 ! jpegdec ! videoconvert ! x264enc pass=qual quantizer=5 tune=zerolatency ! rtph264pay ! udpsink host=127.0.0.1 port=5200

Display RTP stream:

    gst-launch-1.0 udpsrc port=5200 ! "application/x-rtp, payload=127" ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! xvimagesink sync=false
